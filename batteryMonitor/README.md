# Battery Monitor Script
This script was created to help benchmark a LiFePOâ‚„ battery I purchased for my camper.

It monitors power consumption on Linux laptops, including support for (NVIDIA) GPU power monitoring.
The script tracks charging from an external source and automatically exits when charging stops (e.g., when the battery runs out).
